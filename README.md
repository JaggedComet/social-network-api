## Installation

For the application to function, you need a coding software like the free [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and a way to test backend software like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download). For the rest of the requirements, you will just install the required npms with ```npm i``` on the command line in the coding software you are using.

## Usage

You will first begin by doing a `git clone git@github.com:JaggedComet/social-network-api.git` in your command line at the destination of your choice using [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or any other commandline interface. Then you will go to the command line in `VsCode` or the coding software of your choice and run `npm i` in order to install the required files. Then you would run `npx nodemon` in order to run the application. Then you will go to `Insomnia` or the backend testing software of your choice and use the `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/UPDATE` routes seen in the api routes in order to add/remove/update/delete users and thoughts that you input.
